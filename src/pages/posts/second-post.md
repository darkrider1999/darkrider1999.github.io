Hey there! Are you ready to dive into the world of web development and build your very own web application using a modern JavaScript framework? Great! In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the steps of building a simple web application using either React or Angular.

Before we get started, it’s important to note that both React and Angular are popular JavaScript libraries used for building user interfaces (UI). They both offer a range of benefits, such as improved performance, ease of use, and a strong developer community. However, they also have their own unique features and approaches to UI development.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll assume you have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re new to web development, you may want to brush up on these foundational skills before diving into this tutorial.

With that out of the way, let’s get started!
