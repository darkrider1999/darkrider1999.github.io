  Just a simple rock, paper, sheldon game using JavaScript

This was my first project when I was learning Javascript. So, even this might be a simple rock, paper, shotgun code to you. But for me this is the game that inspired me to persue coding in future.

So no matter how small or common this is, this project will always be on my portfolio.

It was just a modified version of the popular game, rock paper shotgun with the fun part of Big Bang Theory, rock, paper, shotgun, lizzard, spook. Since it has 5 objects its always a extended and 'better' version of the classic game.
