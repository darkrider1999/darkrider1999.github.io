On my first ENDG233 final project, we worked on using arrays and exploting data using numpy.

It was mostly based on getting data based on user input from three different .csv files and plot a graph and a pie chart with all the provided information.

Mostly it is a brief python project about importing csv data, plotting from it and extract outputs based on user's selected country.
